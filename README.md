# inter.io
inter.io was founded on the premise of bringing simple and fun do-it-yourself furniture straight to your door step.

We believe anyone with a few tools can build awesome pieces of furniture right in their own home.

Not only that but our goal is to spark creativity in our customers to experiment with out products and come up with their own unique pieces for their homes.

We offer a variety of different styles and look to constantly increase our line of minimalistic home furniture.
